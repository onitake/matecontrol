/**
 * @file clock.h
 * @brief Real time clock driver
 * 
 * This driver provides basic hardware support to drive the avr-libc
 * time module. If `time.h` is not available, a simple API consisting of
 * `time_t`, `time()`, `difftime()` and `set_system_time()` is provided.
 * In this case, you cannot use the calendar functionality of `time.h`.
 * 
 * `time.h` is available in avr-libc 1.8.1 and later. The version is detected
 * automatically and HAVE_TIME_H is set accordingly.
 * 
 * The driver is currently statically configured to use TIMER1 in Fast PWM
 * mode, with overflow occuring at TOP. TOP is set to
 * `CONFIG_QUARTZ / CLOCK_PRESCALER`, with `CLOCK_PRESCALER` equal to 1024.
 * 
 * With a 16MHz quartz, this should result in a precise 1-second interval.
 * 
 * If you prefer to use the builtin API, even if `time.h` is available, define
 * the preprocessor macro `CLOCK_DISABLE_TIME_H`.
 * 
 * @note You should not use timer 1 for other purposes.
 * 
 * @bug The timer configuration is currently static. Allow more control
 * with external defines.
