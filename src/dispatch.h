/**
 * @file dispatch.h
 * @brief Multi-priority dispatch queue
 * 
 * Each priority level has its own queue for a fixed number of events;
 * the queue length is configurable.
 * 
 * The queue relies on a storage pool that needs to be specified on creation.
 * 
 * Memory pool layout:
 * | offset | usage           |
 * |--------|-----------------|
 * | 0      | dispatch        |
 * | 6      | queue head 0    |
 * | 15     | queue head 1    |
 * | 24     | ...             |
 * | N      | queue 0 event 0 |
 * | N+9    | queue 0 event 1 |
 * | N+18   | queue 0 event 2 |
 * | N+27   | ...             |
 * | M      | queue 1 event 0 |
 * | M+9    | queue 1 event 1 |
 * | M+18   | ...             |
