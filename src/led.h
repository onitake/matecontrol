/**
 * @file led.h
 * @brief LED port driver interface
 * 
 * The LED driver supports periodic and one-shot actions. The event queue
 * is used for all of them
 * 
 * led_action() turns a LED on or off, or toggles its state.
 * led_blink() can be used to turn a LED on and off again after a delay,
 * or to make it blink periodically.
 * 
 * @par Configurable options
 * 
 * Macro               | Default  | Values         | Description
 * --------------------|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------
 * LED_QUEUE_SIZE      | [undef]  | 0..255         | Size of the event pool
 * LED_PRIORITY        | [undef]  | 0..127         | Event queue priority
